	<p>A new year and new goals.  It's been almost 23 years since the time I first stepped on a track surface to run my first meet.  I remember as if it was yesterday; I didn't know anyone, I had my 'croydon' running shoes, soccer shorts and a short sleeve shirt.  I wasn't too worried about the way I looked; I was more worried about winning.  I did well on the sprinting, jumping, and throwing events; however, the long distance event (1,200 mts.) was just too much for me; I barely finished it. Even though it was only three laps around the track, it was enough to make me consider taking on a different sport.  I was young and at the time I really didn't have a track coach who would guide me, so I just gave up at the idea of becoming a track athlete.  Almost 5 months after that competition, and for reasons I still don't know, I decided to go back and give track a second chance.  Maybe it was the camaraderie, maybe it was the fresh air, maybe it was my parents' wishes of getting me out of the house to do something better than watching TV, I don't know.  I just know that I showed up at the track and started training. <a id="read-more" href="{{ url }}">Read More</a><span class="more-content">It wasn't long before I started winning local meets; I really didn't have that much competition when it came to short sprints and the long jump.  However, there were a lot of good athletes on the high jump and the ball throwing.  On the long distance races, I didn't stand a chance to win, ever.  I just did my best not to finish last.  There were times when I wanted to once again stop training and go back home to watch TV, specially when I didn' win; however, prepared with a different mentallity and the support and family and friends, I kept on training.  Fast forward twenty years later, and I'm at the Big 12 Conference Championships helping the University of Nebraska win another conference title.  Additionally, that was the time I ran the qualifying standard to participate at the 2000 Syndey Olympic Games in Australia.</span> <a id="read-less" href="{{ url }}">Read Less</a>
