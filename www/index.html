                                 <p>I helped in the development of the Award-winning Facebook application Whopper Sacrifice, which turned heads when it was first introduce in 2008. <a class="read-more" href="whoppersacrifice" data-location="col1_row1">Read More</a> <span class="more-content">Its mission was simple, to allow Facebook users to delete their friends in exchange of a whopper. After 10 friends were deleted, users received a coupon for a free whopper sandwich. Unfortunately, the application lasted about a week before it was sacrificed by Facebook. The good news, over 200,000 fans were willing to delete their friends for a whopper.</span></p>

                                 <p>This is a web-based and iPad application that allows you to create works of art using digital noodles instead of real ones.  I wasn't involved in the development of the actual application; however, I built the subview that gives you information about the newest spoke person for the company and how an image of him was built <a class="read-more" href="dinnernotart" data-location="col1_row2">Read More</a> <span class="more-content">using 125,410 digital noodles.  The artist who created such a piece of art was Thomas Deininger. Each one of the tiles of the main image is retrieved from a json object that is then parsed and placed on the grid depending on its x and y coordinates. The json object also accounts for the number of noodles used on each tile, which is viewable once one is clicked.</span></p>

                                 <p>This website was almost entire built using Flash Actionscript.  The area in which I worked on was Javascript based and worked hand in hand with the Actionscript framework to communicate back and forth which item was selected and if it was available in the user's market.  At the point when the campaign was launched, only three sites in the United States were selected to test the pilot program.  My task was to display information about <a class="read-more" href="babycarrots" data-location="col2_row2">Read More</a> <span class="more-content">the selected product and let the customer know where it could be found only if he/she lived in one of the selected cities.  Since there wasn't a web form in place to ask about the user's location, a backend service was used to retrieve the user's ip address depending on his/her current location.  If the user's location matched one of the three cities, then a list of stores where the new baby carrots were offered was displayed; otherwise, link to print the package was given to the user.</span></p>

                                 <p>The Policy Finder web form was built for the purpose of finding unclaimed life insurance policies. The challenge was working with the current company's framework, including an earlier version of dojo, for which we didn't have access to and making accessible on older browsers such as IE6 and IE7.  I utilized several validation <a class="read-more" href="policyfinder" data-location="col3_row1">Read More</a> <span class="more-content"> techniques to move from one section to another and ajax calls to verify if a policy for an individual was available to be claimed.</span></p>

                                 <p>Another Facebook application I built using both programming languages, Javascript and Flash Actionscript.  The purpose of the app was to let Facebook users know their friends that their Margaritas making abilities such. Again, I needed to obtain basic user information from his/her profile to obtain a list of friends from which one was selected to be the lucky winner of a suck serenade.  The default video player <a class="read-more" href="cuervoserenate" data-location="col3_row2">Read More</a> <span class="more-content">was built on Flash; however, if the user did not have the flash plug-in installed or it was inactive, then a HTML5 video player would take its place.  The user was limited to send only one serenade per session, but he/she had the chance to send as many as he/she pleased.</span></p>

                                 <p>I built this website from the ground up, including wire-frame and design.  I utilized the services for a professional photographer to take pictures of most of the bakery items and organized them according to the client needs.  The website is a combination of HTML, Javascript and Flash Actionscript; it was designed to be viewable also on a mobile device, and I am working on making it compatible with tablets. <a class="read-more" href="genesisbakery" data-location="col4_row1">Read More</a> <span class="more-content">The site supports two of the main languages spoken in the area where the business is located, English and Spanish.  The header, although has been built using Flash Actionscript, it has an HTML version in case the user disables such plug-in or Javascript.</span></p>

                                 <p>I was the Lead Developer for this Flash-based Facebook application which purpose was to match individuals with one of the car on the Volkswagen lineup.  Since all the matching depended on the information the user had on his/her Facebook profile, the first step was to obtain basic and extended permissions from the user to allow us to read all requested profile data.  Once the authorization had been granted, we ran <a class="read-more" href="volkswagen" data-location="col4_row2">Read More</a> <span class="more-content">an algorithm that identify key components on the profile and selected a pair of vehicles that would normally be bought from individuals with similar affinities.  Of course, the matching was not 100% accurate in a few cases but gave way to some laughs.</span></p>
