                <p>I am software developer with advance experience on web standards HTML / HTML5 and CSS / CSS3 architecture, responsive design, and ample knowledge on scripting languages such as JavaScript, Jquery, Ajax, and Backbonejs.</p>
				<p>Additionally, I am proficient in the utilization of JavaScript Object Notation (json). Whenever it is necessary, I apply server side technologies such as PHP and MySQL to communicate and transfer information between the client and server sides. Lastly, I have experience with Adobe Flash ActionScript 2 and 3.</p>
				<p>I have more than 10 years of coding experience in which I have worked as Interactive Developer and Lead Interactive Developer not only for the World Olympians Association but also my employer's current and past clients, which include Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese, Domino's, Baby Carrots, Jose Cuervo, Burger King, Volkswagen, and Microsoft among others.</p>

                                 <p>As part of the development team, I helped creating the Award-winning Facebook application Whopper Sacrifice, which turned heads when it was first introduced in 2008. <a class="read-more" href="whoppersacrifice" data-location="col2_row1">Read More</a> <span class="more-content">Its mission was simple, to allow Facebook users to delete their friends in exchange of a whopper. After an user deleted 10 of his/her friends, he/she received a coupon for a free whopper sandwich. Unfortunately, the application lasted about a week before it was "killed" by Facebook. The good news, over 200,000 fans were willing to part ways with their friends in exchange for a delicious whopper.</span></p>

Only three cities in the United States were selected to test the pilot program.  The user's location was obtained <a class="read-more" href="babycarrots" data-location="col2_row2">Read More</a> <span class="more-content">based on his/her IP address since browser Geolocation was not widely supported at the time.

                                 <p>The Policy Finder web form was built for the purpose of finding unclaimed life insurance policies. Since I could not work within the client's framework, I had to map all of the files into my local machine and replicate 'actual' working environment. Other challenges included working with an earlier version of the scripting language Dojo and older browser accessibility. I utilized several validation <a class="read-more" href="policyfinder" data-location="col3_row2">Read More</a> <span class="more-content"> and scripting techniques to move from one section to another along with Ajax calls to verify claimed insurance availability.</span></p>

                                 <p>Another Facebook application built using both programming languages, JavaScript and Flash ActionScript.  The purpose of the application was for Facebook users to have the chance to tell their friends that their margaritas making abilities needed a lot of improvement. The application first requested access to the user's basic information, which included a list of his/her friends.  Upon acceptance, the application would present the sender with an option to select a friend to be the winner of a Mexican serenade.  It was not long before <a class="read-more" href="cuervoserenate" data-location="col3_row3">Read More</a> <span class="more-content"> hundreds of users were utilizing the application to send 'Suck Serenades'. The default video player was used Adobe Flash; however, if the user did not have the Adobe Flash plug-in installed or it was inactive, then an HTML5 video player would take care of business.</span></p>

                                 <p>I conceptualized, designed and built this site from the ground up.  I utilized the services of a professional photographer to take pictures of most of the bakery items and organized them according to the client needs.  The website is a combination of HTML, JavaScript and Flash ActionScript; it was designed to be viewable also on a mobile device, and I am working on making it compatible with tablets. <a class="read-more" href="genesisbakery" data-location="col4_row1">Read More</a> <span class="more-content">The site supports two of the main languages, English and Spanish, spoken in the area where the business is located.

                                 <p>I was the Lead Developer for this Adobe Flash-based Facebook application which purpose was to match individuals with Volkswagen models. The application's algorithm looked through all of the basic and extended information on a Facebook user's profile and, depending on what was available, provided the user with what would be his/her perfect Volkswagen match.  <a class="read-more" href="volkswagen" data-location="col4_row2">Read More</a> <span class="more-content">The limitation of the application was that it depended solely on the information the user had on his/her profile; the more information it obtained, the better the match; on the other hand, if little information was available, the application would default to one of the basic car models.</span></p>

                                 <p>As part of a campaign to launch a new sitcom series on ABC Canada (Switched at Birth), I developed the 'DNA Test' application, which asked users a couple of funny and unrelated questions to return an even funnier and, in most cases, weirder answer. <a class="read-more" href="sparks" data-location="col4_row3">Read More</a><span class="more-content">The application was built in two days after the request arrived on my desk and put in the time to provide the user with an amazing experience.
