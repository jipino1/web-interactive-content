                    <p>I was born in a little town six hours north of Bogot&aacute;, Colombia. According to my parents, I was the first black child to ever been born in the town's hospital, so a great amount of people stopped by to check me out.  We moved to the city when I was still little; it was a move for the best since it provided us all with better opportunities to shape our futures.  I lived with both my parents and two younger sisters. While in high school, I started running track and found out that I was good at it.</p>
                    <p>In the fall of '96, I was awarded a track scholarship though the Olympic Solidarity program from the International Olympic Committee, which led me to the LaGrange Training Center in Georgia, USA (it later became known as the Savannah TC when the program got moved to that city).</p>
                    <p>After a couple of years in Georgia, I went to the University of Nebraska - Lincoln with a track scholarship to continue my studies on Computer Science and to represent the university at the collegiate level. Athletically I did well; it was a challenge to adjust to a new training/competition routine, but I made it to the conference championships on every year and on the first season I ran the Olympic qualifying standard that allowed me to represent Colombia at the Games of the XXVII Olympiad in Sydney, Australia.  Academically, I graduated with a degree on Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.</p>
                    <p>In Nebraska I also met my wife, <a href=/artist/ title="April's Portfolio">you can check her portfolio here</a>.  After graduation, I moved to Miami while my wife completed her Master's degree on Education; she joined me in the Sunshine state two years later.  Recently we became the proud parents of a baby boy.</p>
                    <p>And that's the short version of my life; the longer version will require a couple of hours, food and some non-alcoholic beverages</p>
